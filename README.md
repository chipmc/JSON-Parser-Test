# JSON-Parser-Test

A project to test the building and maintaining of JSON objects

## Faster Iteration!

By breaking out these functions, I hope to be able to iterate faster and find issues

#### Test Cases:  
# Build and parse a JSON object from a string embedded in the code (use this to understand sizing)
# Test saving a JSON object as a string
# Test storing a JSON object into FRAM and retrieving it
